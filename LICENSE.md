Everything in this respository (both code and documentation) is dual-licesned under [Creative Commons Zero v1.0](./LICENSE-CC0) and the [MIT LICENSE][./LICENSE-MIT].

Beacuse we use CC0, this means you do *not* need to provide any sort of license disclaimer or link to original source when you use these libraries.

You can copy these files directly into your source code, then compile it into a proprietary binary without worrying about attribution or licensing.

This is in contrast to the MIT license, which does require attribution if you copy/paste code.

Dual-licensing with MIT doesn't add any requirements compared to the CC0, becasuse you are free to choose either license.
The second license is simply added for clarity/familiarity.
