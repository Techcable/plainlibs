Lightweight single-file utilities for C99.

=== Key Features

* Portable across Unix & Windows (including MSVC)
* Zero dependencies (besides C stdlib)
* Extremely lightweight

=== Included Libraries

* argparse (header only) (link:./docs/argparse.md[docs])
** A lightweight argument parsing library.

=== Structure

Most of these libraries are header only, although some require an
additional source file (`.c`).

Sometimes this additional source filesis nessicary to either:

[arabic]
. reduce binary size (and avoid duplicating large functions)
. reduce compile times

After adding this to your include path, using a libary should then be as
simple as writing `#include "plain/argparse.h"` (or whatever library you
want) inside your source files (See below).

See below for more detailed instructoions on using this.

=== Using & Building

None of these utilities should require a seperate build step.

The recommended way to include this project is with a git submodule,
however you can also copy source files directly.

Most only require a single header file, although some require an
additional source file.

If the utility you're using requires a source file (`.c`) in addition to
a header file, you can choose to either:

[arabic]
. Make a symbolic link in your project, pointing to the necessary source
file
* Symbolic links are recommended over direct copies, since they will
automatically updgrade with the sub-repo.
. build a static lib containing all the sources, and rely on the linker
to remove unsued sections.
* Almost every linker does this by default (even in debug mode).
* Plus even without this the optimization, the whole library is < 32kb
;)

Option (2) is extremely easy to do if you use meson, otherwise you
probably want to stick with option 1.

==== Simple usage

Add `<path to repo>/include` to your project.

From that point any header-only libraries can be used directly.

If you need to include a `.c` file, consider the options listed above.

==== Copying directly & Submodules

You may copy and paste the needed headers and sources into your library.

Except where otherwise noted, each utility in this library should be
independent of each other.

Since the license is CC0, you don't need to worry about any attribution
when copying/pasting.

An even better alternative is a https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[git submodule],
which simplifies updates.

==== Meson

Because this project has a meosn build file, it is easy to add as a meson dependency
or subproject. Just add it as a submodule in the subprojects directory.

See https://github.com/Techcable/wrap-shell[Techcable/wrap-shell] for a
simple example of how to use this with a meson project.

By defualt, the meson dependency only includes headers (and doesn't
compile any sources).

If the utility you want to use is not header-only, then you can include 
the source file by enabling the corresponding feature as a meson option.
For example, add `default_options : ['toml=enabled']` keyword arg to the
`dependency()` call.

See the link:./meson-options.txt[meson options file] for all available meson options.

=== Portablity

Except where otherwise noted, all of these utilities should be able to
be compiled with a conformant C99 compiler.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, they should all support both Windows
(MSVC) and all Unix-like/POSIX systems.

=== Similar Projects

If plainlibs doesn't have what you're loking for, consider checking out
the following projects:

* https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib/[klib] - Focuses on generic
collections (vector/hashmap)
** Extremely mature and fast :)
** Most headers and utilities in this library can operate indepdently of
each other :)
* https://github.com/zpl-c/zpl[zlib] - General lightweight framework
** Mature (but maybe a little monolithic)
* https://github.com/antirez/sds[sds] - String library used by Redis,
binary compatible with `char*`
* https://github.com/clibs/clib[clib] - The unofficial package manager
for C. Focuses on lightweight libraries
** Mature, lightweight, and builtin support for many libraries
** This can be used with most (or all) of the projects above :)
** The https://github.com/clibs/clib/wiki/Packages[wiki] is also an
excellent place to find lightweight C libraries

list of open-source C projects. It excludes C++ libs, although many of
the libraries are heavyweight :(
